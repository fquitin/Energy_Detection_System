This Folder includes different programs that can be used to receive samples from USRP, retune USRP and plot data received.


Demo_Energy_Detection_Adaptive_Threshold : 

This program is a demo that send the retune command in an infinite loop and plot the received samples each second using gnuplot. The samples received are stored inside two binary files.

Typical threshold values 8 with wsz 8

Demo_Energy_Detection_Fixed_Threshold :

Is the same as before but adapted to the fixed threshold image

Typical threshold values 14 with wsz 8

Rx_n_samples_energy_detection_gnuplot

This program receives n samples from a fixed central frequency and plot the result with gnu plot. Two txt files one for the SQM data and one for the Detection data are stored. Can be used for both the images fixed and adaptive threshold.

Rx_n_samples_frequency_span_gnuplot

This program receives samples retuning the central frequency and plot the result with gnu plot. Two txt files one for the SQM data and one for the Detection data are stored. The retuning is done just one time and not in an infinite loop.

Rx_n_samples_to_file_energy_detection

This program receives n samples from a fixed central frequency and store the received values on a binary file. The type data stored is as following (detection,sqm) = (uint32,uint32).

Rx_n_samples_to_file_frequency_span

This program receives samples retuning the central frequency and store the received values on a binary file for each retuned frequency. The type data stored is as following (sqm,detection) = (uint32,uint32).
